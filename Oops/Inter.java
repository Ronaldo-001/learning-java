     Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methodsâ€”no code allowed. This meant that if you added a new method to an interface, all implementing classes would break unless they implemented the new method.
      So, Java 8 introduced default methods to:
     Allow interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.
      Provide default behavior that implementing classes can override if they want.
